			Ben is a senior at the University of Michigan who will be graduating in May with a Bachelor's of Science.
			While at Michigan, Ben double majored in computer science and film, television and media. This allowed him 
			to refine his coursework so that he could focus on algorithms, distributed systems, and media literacy. Ben is 
			particularly interested in the impact that social algorithms and media targeting have on a user's experience.
